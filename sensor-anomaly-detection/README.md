# Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data

## Problem Statement
To detect abnormal behavior in sensor readings using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset simulates sensor readings including temperature, pressure, and voltage over time.

## Methodology
- Performed exploratory analysis of sensor data
- Selected relevant sensor features
- Applied Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Identified and visualized abnormal sensor readings

## Results
The model successfully detected unusual sensor behavior that could indicate system faults.

## Limitations
- Requires manual tuning of contamination parameter
- Does not explain root cause of anomalies
- Limited dataset size

## Future Scope
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Multivariate time-series models
- Integration with alerting systems
